WHen creating a new user, the initial user is also being created.
And it will only work after you restart the API                      FIXED!

On update, If you dont explictily add all fields, they are deleted.   DONE!

the Delete requests seem to be causing havoc, and this is becasue after a delete, a call to defer db.Close() shuts the db
Down totally. I took out these calls and the app seems to be working perfectly.  FIXED!

The Backend seems to be working fine.
