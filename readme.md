## GO CRUD API

So i'm learning GO. So far I am in love with it, and this is my first attempt at an actual API. I've done all the Go Web Examples that are found [www.gowebexamples.com](here). Basically I took all the examples, learned as much as I could abouot how Go works for building APIS. Routing, Database, JSON, middleware, password hashing, tempaltes, assets and files... Well the last two are only really applicable if you are building an all inclusive web app. I was going to do that. But I decided I'd stick to just the backend, and make a simple frontend with straight HTML, CSS, and JS. Thats the goal. The first commit will still have the templates directory and the statis directory, but they are being 86'd directly. 

Pretty much, as of now... it's just boilerplate. I'm filling it all in as I learn more, and changing things I'm doing wrong.

So I played with the language using a single module, working off of main for a while and then I learned how to structure an actual application. THis is the result of that. No frameworks for the API save gorilla/mux for routing. But that's not really a framework. Gin looks like a really nice framework if you are serious, and as I beging to write production code, I will gravitate to that. For now. No framework. I want to really grasp what Go does and how it does it. 

Statically typed, compiled, stand alone executable, pointers, C type reminicent syntax, built in concurrency, some OOD behaviours like composition, polymorphisim, encapsulation. Man, I really like where this is going. Interfaces were a bit off putting but I get it now. THis is how your polymorphism comes about. THis language is concise and it has just enough meat to be powerful and not a lot of fluff hanging around you just dont't need that only makes your life that much more complex (C++). 

So Let's see hoe this goes. 

So far this project is just boilerplate. Given my 70 hour work weeks, I'll finish, when I finish.
